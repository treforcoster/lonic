A simple, GDPR compliant Google Analytics alternative.

== Description ==

**Website analytics without compromise**
For the longest time, website analytics software was seriously bad. It was hard to understand, time-consuming to use, and worse, it exploited visitor data for big tech to profit. Fathom Analytics is website analytics that doesn't suck. We revolutionized website analytics by making them easy to use and respectful of privacy laws (like GDPR, CCPA, PECR and more).

Note: This plugin requires a paid Fathom Analytics plan to collect website stats. [Pricing starts at $14/month](https://usefathom.com/pricing) and every plan comes with a 7-day free trial.

Instead of generating our revenue from your data, we charge a fair and sustainable price for all our plans. Our business model is privacy-first by design.

## WHY USE FATHOM

1. **[We're GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, PECR (and more) compliant](https://usefathom.com/compliance)**. Because of this, Fathom doesn't require annoying cookie notices.
1. **See all your visitors (not just half).** Millions of people use browser plugins to block scripts. That's why we pioneered the method for by-passing ad blockers, so you get the full picture of who's visiting your site without invading anyone's privacy.
1. **Our script is fast.** Our embed code loads faster than Google Analytics, meaning we're better for your SEO than they are. The script loads from all over the world, from the place closest to the person visiting your site.
1. **Your data is yours,** but we protect it like it's our own. That means you can export it at any time, and while it's saved on our servers, we protect it with the best digital security possible.

## NO COOKIE BANNERS OR GDPR CONSENT NOTICES

We've spent thousands of hours and hired legal professionals from around the world to ensure our software is entirely GDPR, CCPA, PECR, ePrivacy, and COPPA compliant. The bonus here is you don't need an annoying cookie notice for analytics if you use Fathom (you're welcome).

## COLLECT THE DATA YOU NEED TO KNOW

Fathom isn‚Äôt just vanity metrics, it‚Äôs useful data for your business. You can filter by any data point you click on (referrers, pages, countries, etc). You can dig into your campaigns with UTM parameters. You can create custom events like form submissions, PDF links, and so much more.

## RECEIVE WEEKLY/MONTHLY REPORTS

Get a snapshot of your website or websites delivered to your inbox, so you can see your critical stats without even having to log into Fathom. These reports can be set up for any dashboard (or all of them) and sent to anyone (at your company, to your clients, whomever you want).

## DON'T BE THE LAST PERSON TO KNOW YOUR SITE IS OFFLINE

With notifications, you can get alerted via email, text, Telegram or Slack if your website is offline. That way, you can see what's happening before the rest of the world knows something's broken.

## SHARED AND PRIVATE DASHBOARDS

Want to grant access to specific website dashboards for particular clients/employees? Or make your dashboard 100% public? Fathom lets you create private, public or passworded dashboards without needing an account at all.

## MORE FEATURES:

* Simple options page within WordPress admin
* Ability to not track yourself with a single click
* Serves our script automatically, even if you use a custom domain
* Get around ad-blockers that deny Google Analytics
* Search within dashboard boxes
* Dark mode
* All sites view
* And much more

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For more details about Fathom, [visit our website](https://usefathom.com) or check out [our documentation](https://usefathom.com/docs).

#### Why isn‚Äôt Fathom free like Google Analytics?

If you aren't paying for a product, you are the product. That's why Google Analytics is free, because they make enough money off the personal data their customers give them by using their analytics service. We charge a small and sustainable fee for Fathom because our business model is selling software, not data (these very different business models). Our customers gladly pay for our service because they know their data is safe with us and their visitors' privacy is protected. As a profitable business, we're in this for the long haul.

#### Can I use the same plan for multiple websites?

Yes, you can add up to 60 sites/dashboards under a single plan, and they all share your monthly page views.

#### How long do you store my analytics data?

Forever. Meaning, as long as you are a customer, you can access your data all the way back to when you signed up for an account. 7 days, or even 30 days, doesn't give you a clear enough picture of if your website is trending up or down, which is why we give you data retention forever.

#### What happens if I go over my page view limit?

We never charge for occasional traffic spikes, nor do we ever shut your account off if you reach your plan limit early. Instead, if you go over your plan two months in a row or within the first month of joining Fathom, we let you know we‚Äôre upgrading your account. From there, you can decide to stay or cancel your account (no hard feelings either way). You can even export your data if you leave.

#### Why does digital privacy even matter?

You may think that digital privacy doesn‚Äôt matter because you have nothing to hide. And that may be true (to some extent), but your data shouldn‚Äôt be monetized and sold by giant tech companies who are taking your tastes and preferences and selling them to advertisers (including companies like Cambridge Analytica). These companies are following you around the internet, keeping track of what you do, and then using that knowledge to sell you things or manipulate your thoughts.

#### 3.0.1 - January 27, 2021

Set the default to track admins, as some users might miss this when installing Fathom for the first time. We also tested the plugin on Wordpress 5.6 and it's working great.

#### 3.0.1 - December 7, 2020

We've had users running into problems when using WP Rocket minification. We spoke to their support team and they advised us on how to exclude the Fathom script from minification. Huge thanks to Jon Henshaw (@henshaw) for initially raising this.

#### 3.0.0 - May 12, 2020

This update includes breaking changes, so please read this message.
1) If you have any manual goals added, you should change them to follow our new guide (see [here](https://usefathom.com/support/goals)). Added new tracking code.
2) You can now exclude your own traffic even when you're logged out, we've added big improvements for custom domains and things are much faster.
3) If you use Fathom Lite, stick to 2.0.4, as you have everything you need

#### 2.0.4 - May 9, 2020

Switched it around. A lot of Wordpress sites use goals so we can't use the new API yet, that'll have to come in a major number

#### 2.0.3 - May 9, 2020

We have released brand new tracking code for custom domain users, removed the old fallback and things will now load much faster.

#### 2.0.2 - April 15, 2020

Small fix with version control

#### 2.0.1 - April 15, 2020

What a time to be alive. We have officially added custom domains to Fathom to help with those pesky ad-blockers. And we moved the snippet to the footer (where it escaped from).

#### 2.0.0 - November 15, 2019

Well first of all, we are sorry for the long delay in updating this plugin! We've been busy at work on Fathom V2 all year. In this major update of the wordpress plugin, we've ensured backward compatability but have modified the guidelines to include some of the new changes we have made. Firstly, the concept of a "Dashboard URL" doesn't exist within V2, and you simply use the CDN URL! Nice and easy. But we have left the Dashboard URL in place for our V1 users who self-host. We've also added the ability for V2 users to embed their dashboard & create a new tab in the admin menu.


#### 1.0.1 - October 10, 2018

Added support for tracking multiple sites in a single Fathom dashboard (requires Fathom v1.0.1).


#### 1.0.0 - September 10, 2018

Plugin release.
